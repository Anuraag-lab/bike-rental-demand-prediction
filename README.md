# bike-rental-demand-prediction
Python project analyzing the BoomBikes dataset to predict bike rental demand using EDA, feature engineering, and regression modeling.
# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Rental Demand Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **BoomBikes bike-sharing dataset** to uncover factors affecting rental demand and build a predictive model.  
The analysis was done in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression techniques.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains daily bike-sharing data with features such as:  
- 📅 Date  
- 🌦️ Season & Weather conditions  
- 🌡️ Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed  
- 🏢 Working day vs Holiday  
- 👥 Casual vs Registered users  
- 🚲 Total rentals  

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis & Insights  
✔️ Conducted **EDA** to explore rental trends across seasons and weather.  
✔️ Performed **feature engineering** and preprocessing (encoding, scaling).  
✔️ Built a **Multiple Linear Regression model** for demand prediction.  
✔️ Found that **seasonality, weather, and working days** strongly impact demand.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → visualization  
- **Scikit-learn, Statsmodels** → regression modeling  

---

## 📊 Example Visualization  
*(Add an image from your notebook here, e.g. rentals by season or weather impact on demand)*  

---

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anuraag-kaushal/bike-rental-demand-prediction.git
2.Open the notebook : jupyter notebook BoomBikes_Analysis.ipynb
3.Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.


📌 Results

The regression model explained a significant portion of variance in bike rentals.

Weather, temperature, and working days were the strongest predictors of demand.

These insights can help BoomBikes optimize operations and marketing.
